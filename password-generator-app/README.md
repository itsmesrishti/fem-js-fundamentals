## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- Clipboard API

### What I learned

I learned how input range sliders can be customised, how to create random passwords, how a text can be copied using an api.

### Continued development

Currently the password strength is only being determined by the length. I want to work on it to also consider the features included in the password while determining the strength.

### Useful resources

- [How to customize sliders](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-custom-range-slider/) - This helped me customize the sliders to fit the design provided.
